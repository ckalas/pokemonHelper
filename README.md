pokemonHelper
=============

# Java

This contains a GUI with an Eclipse build currently only for OSX.

# Python

This contains Python code that parses some raw html stored in pokeData.py and provides a command line interface for using it. The code really should be parsing the text files instead of the html, but haven't got around to that.
